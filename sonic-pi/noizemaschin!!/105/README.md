# Source code for my performance for NoizeMaschin!! #105
## (Event theme: "1 c0d3d 17 my53lf")

Each work for this event involved the artist using code in some part of its construction.
**My contribution:** "Mellow", a chilled melodic piece composed in [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

There is also [a video of this piece](https://youtu.be/0qeX0dAja4Y).
[The full NoizeMaschin!! #105 video](https://youtu.be/xZ3bTW9gr0w) including this and all the other artists' performances is also viewable.
