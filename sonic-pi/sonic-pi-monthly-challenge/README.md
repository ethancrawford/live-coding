# Sonic Pi Monthly Challenge

## What's in this directory
The files here are the source code for my contributions to a series of monthly challenges put to the Sonic Pi community. The idea is that each month, a challenge is given to produce a musical composition using Sonic Pi, which meets certain requirements - perhaps styled in a particular genre, using a certain type of audio sample or synth instrument, etc.

## Minimum Sonic Pi version required
Versions may vary - see comments in individual files for details.
